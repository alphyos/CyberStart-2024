## About

Originally a passion project to grasp individual concepts explored on the platform and develop a keen understanding that allows me to educate and help others with challenges quickly and in a manner any beginner would understand. Note that **none of the writeups will have the flag** in plain text and it is *highly encouraged* that you take your best stab at the challenge before recieving help. 

Please refer to the [questions](#questions-and-feedback) section before asking questions of your own about the challenges to ensure thoughtful discussion. ⭐'s are highly appreciated :o)
