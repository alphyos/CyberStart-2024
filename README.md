## About

Originally a passion project to grasp individual concepts explored on the platform and develop a keen understanding that allows me to educate and help others with challenges quickly and in a manner any beginner would understand. Note that none of the writeups will have the flag in plain text and it is *highly encouraged* that you take your best stab at the challenge before recieving help. Please refer to the questions section of this README before asking questions of your own about the challenges to ensure thoughtful discussion. ‚≠ê's are highly appreciated :o)
