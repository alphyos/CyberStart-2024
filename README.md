## About

Originally a passion project to grasp individual concepts explored on the platform and develop a keen understanding that allows me to educate and help others with challenges quickly and in a manner any beginner would understand. Now that CyberStart is officially closing as of January 12th, 2024, this project has turned into a full conservation effort to preserve what was deemed most important of all challenges including the files, vms, and field manual resources along with original walkthroughs. 

⭐'s are highly appreciated :o)

### Challenge Template

```md
# :emoji: Title - L# C#

Briefing goes here, if applicable, I like to replace "Agent" w/ "Agent 707" for some odd reason
**Tip**: Hi! This template is if you want to contribute with your own writeups!

💡 Hint: The hint goes here, but remember to remove the escape backslash characters for the codeblock! \

## Step by Step

- Bullet points of information can be emphasized using `code highlights` or **bold**, *italicized*, or any other unique emphasis deemed fit
  - Inner bullets can also be utilized
- Just remember that bullet pointed statements DO NOT end with punctuation (!)

![all lowercase image description](/assets/lowercasedchallengename1.png)
Asset files are all lowercased and ends in a number 1 - n depending on the order in which it is used

Finally, links can be attached to text using the syntax: [a friendly text which describes what the redirect is to](https://the.url-that-will-redirect.users)
