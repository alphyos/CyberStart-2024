# â›° Uphill Section - L05 C05

We've hit a bit of a stumbling block in our investigation and need your urgent help - our client is planning to do their pitch to the marathon committee in the next few days so we need to get the report finished. Unfortunately, we've received an important pcap containing potentially malicious files from our field agents and it seems to be corrupt. We've been unable to open it. Can you help?

**Tip:**Â Find a way to open the pcap to get the flag.

- Run `make` and `sudo make install`
- Use pcapfix on the pcap file: `./pcapfix filename`

- A file should appear in the pcapfix directory
- Open the `fixed_filename` file in wireshark
- Filter for http traffic
- One of the two packets contains the flag
