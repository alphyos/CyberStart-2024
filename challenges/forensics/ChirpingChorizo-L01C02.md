As soon as our agents knew which of the employees might be suspects in the case we started recording and logging theirÂ **phone conversations**Â to see if we could find anything interesting. We know for example that the companiesÂ **banking password**Â somehow got out to a conspirator. Can youÂ **hear anything in this conversation**Â which might give you an indication?

**Tip:**Â Find the banking password, that's the flag.
