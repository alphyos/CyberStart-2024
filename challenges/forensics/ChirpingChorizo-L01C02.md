# ☎️ Chirping Chorizo - L01 C02

As soon as our agents knew which of the employees might be suspects in the case we started recording and logging their **phone conversations** to see if we could find anything interesting. We know for example that the company's **banking password** somehow got out to a conspirator. Can you **hear anything in this conversation** which might give you an indication?

**Tip:** Find the banking password, that's the flag.

```
💡 Hint: Try opening the file in a media player. Do they mention any codes or numbers in the call?
```

## Step by Step

- Download the file and listen to it. 
- The conversation mentions a **reference number**: 
    - `08[REDACTED]LW` 

<!--- i literally don't know how to make this any easier to understand, oh well --->
