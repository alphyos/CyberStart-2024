# üèù Island Image - L06 C04

Here's a question for you, Agent 707 - one our team was never able to answer. We have a disk image file taken from the hacker which we know ran a number of oddly named executable files on the target machine, but we don't know what the names mean. Can you unravel the name of one of the programs?

**Tip:**¬†One of the filenames (excluding its extension) contains the flag.

## Step by Step</summary>

- Download and extract the zip file and examine with `Autopsy`
- You are looking for a program that is a prefetch file with the extension of `.pf`
- Looking under **Data Artifacts** and **Run Programs**, you will find many prefetch files but many of these have normal seeming names

- At the end of this list are a couple odd looking names, copy and paste the name of the very last entry without including the extension and put it through a Caesar Cipher
- You can recognize these file names are odd because they are composed of random letters
- Once decoded, it should produce the flag

`flag: PREFETCHWIN`
