# ðŸ’¼ Dubious Jobs - L03 C04

As part of our work helping the New York branch, we took on the task of monitoring some of the sites the hackers have been looking at - one of which was a job board for graphic designers. We managed to get aÂ **network capture**Â of one of them viewing a job posting which we suspect has a secret message in it. See if you can confirm that by looking at this pcap (packet capture) file.

**Tip:**Â TheÂ **flag**Â is in the file.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Have you tried using a tool called 'Wireshark'? It has a follow stream option which can be helpful in identifying traffic. There's also an option to find specific packets. Perhaps try searching for the string "flag" and see would you find.
