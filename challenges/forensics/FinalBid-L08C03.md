- It says something similar to the following:
  - "Hello from `Athens`, Our work here is almost complete. The `antique dealers` we have been working with¬†have been instrumental in helping us to hack into the digital auction system. Without them we would be stuck at the script kiddie level! I suspect we will have all we need very soon, you know what you need to do, so just keep doing it. This time next year we will be millionaires."
