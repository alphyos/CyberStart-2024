## Step by Step</summary>

- Download the file and either view the file contents with `cat filename`or a pdf parser with a command such as `pdf-parser filename`
- Digging around through there, you should spot a section labeled as "fonts" with a series of hex numbers hidden nearby
- Decoding this string of numbers  into ASCII gives you the flag

`flag: h1d1ng_am0ng_t3h_f0nt5`
