# ðŸ—‘ Dash Delete - L05 C04

So here's what we know so far â€“ someone gained access to the company's servers, set up accounts and left suspicious files. We also think they may have deleted at least one important file called â€˜coms.txtâ€™, but fortunately not in a forensically sound way. Can you find anything important in this file?

**Tip:**Â Find what they deleted to get the flag.

## Step by Step</summary>

- Download the file and extract the contents
- Put it through Autopsy and it should detect items that were deleted/in the recycle bin
- Of these, one of them has a path with "Coms.txt" and within the text of that file is a lot of random strings
- Observing very closely, there is the flag in plain text
