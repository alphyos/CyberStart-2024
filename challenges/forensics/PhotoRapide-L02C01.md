# 📷 Photo Rapide - L02 C01

It looks like the photographer took a particular interest in what the employees of the business were doing whilst he was in their shop. We think he actually saw one of them enter the **password** to one of their internal systems and then hid it, **in plain sight, in a photo** he took. Our team gained access to the photo files he didn't share with the business. Can you **look closely** to see if he's using them to hide the passwords?

**Tip:** Find the password he stole, it's the flag.
