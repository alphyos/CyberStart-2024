# ðŸ“· Photo Rapide

It looks like the photographer took a particular interest in what the employees of the business were doing whilst he was in their shop. We think he actually saw one of them enter theÂ **password**Â to one of their internal systems and then hid it,Â **in plain sight, in a photo**Â he took. Our team gained access to the photo files he didn't share with the business. Can youÂ **look closely**Â to see if he's using them to hide the passwords?

**Tip:**Â Find the password he stole, it's the flag.

ðŸ’¡ Hint: It's a high-resolution image, have you tried zooming in and looking at the detail?

## Step by Step

- Download the image and zoom into it.
- The flag is in plain text somewhere on the right
