# ðŸŒƒ Peculiar Portfolio - L03 C02

One of the graphic designers also works as a photographer and usually posts his images on his personal portfolio. But our team noticed he created a second portfolio with just oneÂ **image**Â on it, which we thought was strange. It made us think maybe itÂ **contained a secret message**Â of some kind. Take a look and see what you think.

**Tip:**Â The image contains a secret, that's the flag.
