# ðŸŽ‘ Remote Access - L02 C04

After we initially spoke to the owner of the small business as part of our team's initial recon he has been back in touch to let us know that some otherÂ **strange things**Â have been happening on one of the office PC's outside of normal business hours. We think sometime around theÂ **1st of September**Â the photographer logged onto the business network remotely. Take a look at the log files we have forÂ **login events**Â and see what you can find.

**Tip:**Â The name of the account the photographer used to log in is the flag.
