# ðŸ¦’ Social Safari - L04 C01

One of the customers who had their laptop hacked was kind enough to let us take a look. We believe the hacker social engineered them into downloading a file from a website which turned out to be malware. That gave the hacker a backdoor to the system, from which they then laterally moved across the network. Can you figure out how they did it?

**Tip:**Â The flag is the remote computer name.

**Note:**Â The files for this challenge are the same as Level 4 Challenge 3 and only need downloading once.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Look at the login type to determine if someone logged in from a remote source. Not all remote logins show as type 10 logins, think of different types of sessions and where they would be.
