# ðŸ¤³Suspicious Selfie - L01 C01

Our agents have gained access to the employees work phone and downloaded a bunch ofÂ **photos**Â they took to see if we can spot any signs of mischief. For example, we know they somehow gave a conspirator on the outside internalÂ **passwords**Â to computers but haven't yet been able to figure out how.Â **Can you see anything**Â in this image that looks suspicious?

**Tip:**Â Find the password, that's the flag.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Can you see any text in the photo? Keep in mind that the word 'password' is sometimes shortened to 'pw'.
```

## Step by Step

- Download the image and zoom in closely to the sticky note on the bottom right of the monitor.
