# ðŸ’” Volatile Memory - L03 C05

When our team in New York came across a couple of PC's they thought might have been compromised by the hackers they took someÂ **memory dumps**Â toÂ **analyse**. Take a look at this one with a tool calledÂ **Volatility**Â and see if you can identify the running processes and see if you can spot any that look suspicious.

**Tip:**Â TheÂ **suspicious process**Â is the flag.
