## An extremely powerful operating system

For some people this is going to be an area that at first will seem
quite complicated. Linux can take a little while to get to grips with,
but it's absolutely worth the investment to familiarise yourself with
it.

On Linux you're going to find incredibly powerful tools for computer
science in general, but more specifically cyber security - whether
you're interested in breaking into web applications or forensically
analysing interesting memory dumps; Linux has the tools to make all of
this a lot easier. It's an extremely powerful operating system!

Under the Linux banner you'll find many different 'distributions'. A
Linux distribution brings together the Linux kernel - the core of the
operating system that will be largely the same - with a package manager,
 allowing you to install different types of software and customise the
operating system. Each distribution will look and function a little
different, but if you explore a few of them you'll likely find one that
works well for you!

Different 'distros' will likely also also include a GUI (Graphical
User Interface - the visual portion you interact with on screen) that's
similar to what you're likely already familiar with. It may also include
 applications you'll have seen before - internet browsers such as
Firefox, office software for writing documents or creating spreadsheets,
 as well as a settings section for customising the system.

While hopefully familiar, there are likely to be a few differences.
One of the main features you might not have encountered much before is
the **terminal**, also known as the **command line**.
 This is where you'll spend a lot of time! Here, you can execute
commands, and commands can be chained together in very powerful ways.
From the command line, in the future you'll be able to break passwords,
access binary files, find security weaknesses and more.

A common way to run a Linux operating system without needing a
separate machine, or repurposing an existing one, is using a Virtual
Machine. Check out the [CyberStart virtual machine](https://play.cyberstart.com/field-manual/8f99f5da-d7eb-11eb-b0e8-0242ac140009)
 for a great place to get started with this. You can also explore
running your own choice of Linux distro such as Ubuntu or Arch Linux for
 greater customisation.

*Note that while exploring a different distro is a great way to
learn more and better familiarise yourself with Linux; you'll need to
install various tools that will come in handy for CyberStart, which are
otherwise pre-installed on the Cyberstart VM.*

> practice and could be one of the most valuable tech skills you develop.
