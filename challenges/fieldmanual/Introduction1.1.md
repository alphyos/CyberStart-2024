# CyberStart Field Manual

Welcome to the CyberStart Field Manual. Here you'll find learning resources which will provide knowledge and skills for fascinating topics, and help you break through challenges when you're stuck or would like a little more info. We'll cover crucial defensive and offensive tactics, plus some tools to help you crack passwords, find vulnerabilities, write code, break code, pick apart binaries and much more.

The Field Manual content is grouped into some of the major cyber security topics to help you find the areas you're seeking quickly. It's primarily intended as a tool to help you work through the various challenges in CyberStart, but it's also great as a standalone resource too.

If you're new to the industry it might be a good idea to read through pages in order, but if you're more experienced you may want to jump to a particular section. Whatever your skill level and approach, be sure to both watch the videos and read the text; there may be useful info and examples in either that could be just what you need.

Throughout the CyberStart Field Manual you will find videos, text and references to other tools or resources. However, please note - while the Field Manual is a great resource, you should also take advantage of the incredible knowledge and tools on the broader Internet; be sure to use either to find solutions! It is not cheating to search for particular types of tools, scenarios, bugs or attacks and use that knowledge to your advantage!

It's also completely normal not to understand things first time, and you may need to watch the videos, read text and also practice a few times to really get things. A side note to this however - persistence is very important, but also try different approaches and remember to take a break when needed.

All that said, we hope you find the CyberStart Field Manual useful and good luck on solving the challenges!
