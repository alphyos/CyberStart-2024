# Converting And Editing
Having data in hex format doesn't change the underlying data, it is just a more efficient way of communicating that data. For this reason it's often used as a means of encoding and sometimes computers will convert data to hexadecimal before transmitting it. A lot of web applications will do this, for example.

If you want to convert data to or from other formats quickly and easily, there's some great online tools available. Simply just search for what you'd like to achieve and there will be a range of great tools ready to covert data for you.

There's some great hex editing tools to make use of if you need to do more than just a quick conversion. Some of these might be [hexedit](https://linux.die.net/man/1/hexedit) if you want to edit some hex in your terminal, [Ghex](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Ghex) if you'd prefer a GUI app and there's great online editors such as [HexEd](https://hexed.it/) if you don't want to install anything and just want something in your browser.
