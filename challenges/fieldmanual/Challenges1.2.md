## Solving challenges

CyberStart is absolutely packed with different sorts of challenges -
from programming in Moon Base, digital forensics focus in the Forensics
base and the mixture of challenge types in Intern and HQ bases. There's
something for everyone! You can pick different paths through CyberStart
depending on your experience and interests, but we find most will start
at the Intern or HQ bases to start improving their general skills.

When you undertake a challenge, you are looking for a **flag**.
 This could be a string of characters or an answer to a question
provided by the challenge briefing. For example, inside a file you might
 find `flag:An0th3r0N3` as an identifiable string of alphanumeric characters. In this instance the portion you submit for points is `An0th3r0N3`.

Alternatively, the briefing may ask you to find a relevant piece of
information - a name, city, email address etc. - which you'll uncover
while solving the challenge. Much like the real world, it won't always
have a `flag:` prefix, and the best advice we can give is *"you'll know you've got the flag when you see it"*.

Once you've got the flag, it's best to copy and paste it into the
flag submission box and hit the button. This will then tell you if it's
correct or not, and if it's correct you'll get a celebratory animation
and some points.
