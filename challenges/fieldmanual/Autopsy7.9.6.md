 is an open source Digital Forensic Tool, it can be used with a GUI or
just from the command line. First you must create a case and then import
 your desired memory image or disk image into the case. From there you
can recover files from them. There are a whole host of features that
Autopsy contains, such as timeline analysis, keyword searches, media
playback, metadata analysis, email analysis, unicode string extraction
and many more!
