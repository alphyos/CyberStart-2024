# Customising your browser

The modern browser is a miracle of technology with all kinds of amazing features, even hidden ones you may not use day to day like the developer tools. However, there is also an ecosystem of capabilities designed to allow you to extend your browser in ways that may benefit you generally, or for specific cyber security disciplines.

These extra capabilities are known as **plugins** or **extenions** and can add specific features, such as being able to download all images, pull text content from a page and more. You'll be able to find a plug-in to switch **user agent** (that's an identifying string sent by your browser that says what type of device, browser & version you are using) so you can pretend to be an iOS device, or Windows, or another type and version of browser. Believe it or not, this can be useful in bypassing some security controls! We've seen this switching of user agents previously executed in a security test where we saw that pretending to be an iOS device or printer, skipped the authentication that Windows clients had to complete (they didn't support the scheme so were exempt)!

By searching other tools you can find plug-ins which will change how your data is displayed, find URLs to manipulate, extract GIFs, de-obfuscate JavaScript, and much more. The extension ecosystem certainly is powerful!

>All that said, do keep security in mind when installing plug-ins. A browser plug-in could access your personal information or track you. Malicious plug-ins do exist, though they are more commonly found by installing them from broader Internet locations, instead of the 'store' provided by a given browser. Even then, using a plug-in which is popular and widely validated is prudent. If you are unsure, running a test in a Virtual Machine is a good way to experiment safely.
