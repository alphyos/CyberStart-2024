# Best Practices

Here we'll cover some basics of cyber security awareness, helping you to make life much harder for cyber criminals by rendering their attacks less effective. This can often be done by remembering simple practices, such as not sharing sensitive data publicly, researching and applying safety tips and staying on top of industry news.

Even if you play CyberStart and do not decide it is your future passion, this is a great time to apply some sensible cyber security practices.

> 95% of the battle in building your cyber security defences is knowing to care. A huge majority of cyber attacks happen due to failure to implement essential hygiene steps, such as updating your software regularly.

Check out advice from [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) and [SANS Security Awareness](https://www.sans.org/security-awareness-training/) plus major technology vendors such as Microsoft. Government standards organisations are also a great place to find practices you can apply. They are one search away!

You will find numerous 'top ten' or 'top twenty' practices, but we would like to draw attention to the following in particular:

1. **Password hygiene** Suitable password storage & usage practices, including avoiding repeated use of passwords or common predictable passwords. Consider the use of a password manager!
2. **Update when possible** The importance of updating your software, such as your web browser or OS. Even mobile phones have security patches bundled with their updates and failure to apply them can allow attackers access to your data. Consider all your devices - whether it's a PC, phone, tablet and perhaps even IoT item.
3. **Disaster recovery** Plan for 'when' it goes wrong. Ransomware (which encrypts your data and demands money to gain access to it again) is a very popular with cyber criminals, and if you are impacted a recovery plan is key to already have in place. How do you backup and restore your data so you don't need to pay them?
> Researching cyber security hygiene basics and sharing it with your friends and family is a great way to practice explaining cyber security concepts and help them be safer online!
