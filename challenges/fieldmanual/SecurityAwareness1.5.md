## Best practices

Here we'll cover some basics of cyber security awareness, helping you
 to make life much harder for cyber criminals by rendering their attacks
 less effective. This can often be done by remembering simple practices,
 such as not sharing sensitive data publicly, researching and applying
safety tips and staying on top of industry news.

Even if you play CyberStart and do not decide it is your future
passion, this is a great time to apply some sensible cyber security
practices.

> 95% of the battle in building your cyber security defences is knowing
> to care. A huge majority of cyber attacks happen due to failure to
> implement essential hygiene steps, such as updating your software
> regularly.

Check out advice from [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) and [SANS Security Awareness](https://www.sans.org/security-awareness-training/)
 plus major technology vendors such as Microsoft. Government standards
organisations are also a great place to find practices you can apply.
They are one search away!

You will find numerous 'top ten' or 'top twenty' practices, but we would like to draw attention to the following in particular:

1. **Password hygiene** Suitable password storage &
usage practices, including avoiding repeated use of passwords or common
predictable passwords. Consider the use of a password manager!
1. **Update when possible** The importance of updating
your software, such as your web browser or OS. Even mobile phones have
security patches bundled with their updates and failure to apply them
can allow attackers access to your data. Consider all your devices -
whether it's a PC, phone, tablet and perhaps even IoT item.
1. **Disaster recovery** Plan for 'when' it goes wrong.
Ransomware (which encrypts your data and demands money to gain access to
 it again) is a very popular with cyber criminals, and if you are
impacted a recovery plan is key to already have in place. How do you
backup and restore your data so you don't need to pay them?

> Researching cyber security hygiene basics and sharing it with your
> friends and family is a great way to practice explaining cyber security
> concepts and help them be safer online!
