## Machine readable encoding

Barcodes are designed to be a machine-readable representation of
encoded data. You'll have no doubt seen these on almost anything
purchased in a shop, containing information about the product and
allowing the checkout to look up the price of the item. These common
types of barcode are a form of **linear** barcode.

By contrast, a QR code - which is an abbreviation of **Quick Response code** - is a type of **matrix**
 barcode. Due to its 2-dimensional layout, it's able to represent much
more data in the same area compared to a linear barcode. The type of
encoding, however, is similar.

Both can contain all sorts of data - URLs, strings, phone numbers and
 more. Linear barcodes are, however, much more limited with how much
data can be encoded. You can use specialised devices such as scanners at
 a checkout to read them, but can use your phone too - either with a
pre-installed app, or perhaps one from your phones' app store.

> QR codes can be processed by your phone and automatically open a URL
> they contain. However, if you are analysing unknown data you may wish to
> use a tool that does not auto-open URLs. You can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) or various command line tools to achieve this by providing a copy of the QR code to extract data from.

**Important note!** You might decide to use your phone
to scan a QR code. That is great on some devices. However, some devices
won't read all QR code types. For example, iPhones will only read URLs
and not show text. If you run in to this, try using another app instead.
