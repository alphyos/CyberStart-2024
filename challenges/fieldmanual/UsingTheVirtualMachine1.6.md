## The CyberStart virtual machine

 As you grow your skills in cyber security and complete more of
 CyberStart you will run in to the need for real tools. You can get
 far with creativity and a web browser, but at some point, you will
 need to use specialised tools and without them progressing through
 challenges will be hard, plus you won't be learning as much as you
 could.

 So what is a virtual machine? Well, a virtual machine is likely to
 contain a whole other operating system and file system, which you
 can interact with in a window on your computer. With virtual
 machine software installed such as VMWare or VirtualBox, you'd
 load the VM image (that's the OS - typically Linux, macOS or
 Windows & file system mentioned) and then start interacting
 with it in your player window. This provides a safe place to try
 out experiments or play with a specific OS.

[VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
 &
 [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 have free and commercial versions, though you will need admin
 rights to install and use the software.

 With the software installed, you can download the VM image from
 the appropriate link:

[Download the VMWare virtual machine](https://vm.cyberstart.com/v2/cyberstart-vm-vmware.zip)

[Download the VirtualBox virtual machine](https://vm.cyberstart.com/v2/cyberstart-vm-vbox.zip)

 Once you have downloaded the appropriate zip file, unzip it and
 load that unzipped VM image into your software. Our CyberStart VM
 image is Linux based, specifically Ubuntu. When it's up and
 running you'll see a login screen for `agent` and the
 password for this account is `agent` for simplicity.
 However, to ensure you use strong passwords you may want to change
 this after login.

 Our VM also contains many of the tools you'll need to complete the
 challenges, all installed and preconfigured for you. These tools
 which include the terminal, hex editor, network analysis tools and
 much more are the same tools real cyber security professionals
 use, so great to get to grips with.

> **Tip: Memory** - if you find your VM is running a
> little slow, it could be set initially to use a low amount of
> RAM (memory). You may want to look at the current setting and if
> you've resources available, increase it.

> **Tip: Keyboard** - Should the characters on screen
> not be the same as the ones pressed on your physical keyboard,
> you may also have to adjust the keyboard settings to match your
> country.
