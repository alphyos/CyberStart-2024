## BINARY

# Introduction to binaries

To start
with, let's clear up some potential confusion! Generally speaking, a
binary file is any type of file that is not just a simple text file.
That is, they contain data that is interpreted as something other than
text characters.

In our case we'll be using the term to refer to compiled executable
code. These are often referred to as binaries. Binaries in of themselves
 are not that complex. You write some code, you run it through a
compiler and it produces an object file, which is then packaged in an
executable.

Binaries contain computer code that has been optimised to execute on a
 specific architecture and processor, though sometimes they have the
ability to run on more than one. Architectures you may run into include:

* x86
* MIPS
* x64
* ARM

This list is not exhaustive and some are capable of being used
interchangeably. Each of these has different features, limitations and
requirements.

In the earlier stages of CyberStart you are more than likely just
running binaries. As your skills grow you might compile them. Even
beyond that we may find the ability to manipulate a binary into doing
things it should not! This is the path to binary exploitation. An
advanced skill, not for the faint of heart, but really fascinating.
