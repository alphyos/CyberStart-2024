# Steganography

Steganography
 is the practice of concealing data within other data. At the most basic
 level, you could open another file (like an image) in a text editor and
 hide a message inside of it.

It's not a new technique however; steganography has been widely used
for centuries. From hidden messages written in secret inks on paper, to
messages written in Morse code on yarn and knitted into pieces of
clothing worn by messengers. If you look back in history, there are
several instances where steganography has played an integral part in the
 transmission of secret messages. It was also used during World War II,
whereby espionage agents used microdots to send messages back and forth,
 and even used photosensitive glass!

More modern usage of steganography includes concealing messages
within the lowest bits of images, concealing data within encrypted or
random data and, in its simplest of forms, embedding hidden messages in
image files.

In several states and countries where social or government taboos and
 censorship are present, social steganography is used. This takes the
form of hiding messages in pop culture references, hiding messages in
the titles and context of a shared video or image, and misspelling names
 or words that are popular in the media, in order to suggest an
alternative meaning. This technique relies on public sharing.

Detection of steganography can be difficult! It requires careful physical examination and is often a time-consuming process. *Steganalysis* is the term used to represent the simplest method of detecting modified files. *Stegware* is also a term being used currently to represent the hiding of cyber-attacks, making detection an inadequate defence.

Audio steganography is a technique used to embed secret messages into
 digital audio. It works by modifying audio signal in an imperceptible
manner. There are various methods of audio steganography, such as LSB
and Echo Hiding.

**LSB** - LSB (Least Significant Bit) is an algorithm
used in conjunction with steganographic techniques for embedding text
into images and also into audio. It does this by converting the audio
sample into bits, into which the text data is then embedded. By using an
 LSB based algorithm, the capacity for hiding text increases.

**Echo Hiding** - Echo based hiding algorithms are very
popular within audio steganography, mainly for their robustness in
compression, imperceptibility, similarity to LSB and their capacity.

Modern day usage of audio steganography can be shown in examples such
 as hidden sounds triggering smart devices (Alexa) and ringtones only
younger people can hear; filtering by age - scary but true!

Steganography is an important subject within forensics, as it is
continually and more increasingly being used in cyber attacks. Attackers
 are using steganography to inject malicious content into files, in
order to evade modern day security defences.
