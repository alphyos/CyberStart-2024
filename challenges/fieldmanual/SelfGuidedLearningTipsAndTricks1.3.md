# Self guided learning tips and tricks

Cyber
security is diverse and fun! There are multiple disciplines and skills
that could capture your interest, from hacking applications to closing
security holes before the cyber criminals find them, to forensically
reconstructing what happened if they do.

As you embark on your journey you are bound to hit challenges and
frustrations, so we put together this list of 7 things to keep in mind
on your journey. They will help you crush challenges, score points, and
learn skills that you could even use in the future in a job defeating
real cyber criminals!

1. **Use search engines to find more about attacks, tools or other topics.** It is not cheating. Try to avoid finding spoilers to a challenge unless you get *really* stuck as you will make it harder to progress in later levels.
2. **When you don't see the answer, work in phases - solve, reflect, solve, reflect.**
 Take some time to investigate and search, browse around the code or try
 to solve it. Then take some time to step back and think. It is very
easy to spend all your time focused on the details and miss something
obvious. Step back and the solution may come to you!
3. **Can you use a tool or do you need to do it manually?**
 Depending on where you are up to in CyberStart you may or may not need a
 tool to solve your problem. In some cases, a tool can save you hours of
 manual work, but in others it can be inflexible and you'll be better
off writing a custom script to solve it, or even do it by hand. Think
about the problem, try and visualize how the solution might work and you
 can often 'place a bet' on which path may be quicker.
4. **It is OK to be wrong!** Lots of agents will spend
their time focused on the very first solution they came up with. That is
 wonderful if the solution is right, but what if you are headed down the
 wrong path? You should bravely pursue what you think the solution might
 be, but be prepared to admit you took the wrong path. In the end you'll
 solve challenges and learn faster.
5. **Working with friends and community members is just smart!**
 Some of us like to work alone for fear of any tiny spoiler that might
suggest we didn't solve the challenge alone. It makes sense to not want
to rob yourself of learning opportunities, but learning with friends
will also expand your horizons of different solutions. Many challenges
have more than one path or method.
6. **Follow the white rabbit - research topics further.**
If you are enjoying a topic and are interested in how something works,
search for more background information. Perhaps you have just
successfully used `ssh` for the first time and connected to a
 server but want to know how it is secured. It may not help you solve
the challenge, but this technology is *amazing*! Every bit of
background knowledge you gain will help you progress further and build a
 library you can draw on in the future. It will also help you get a job
in this industry if you love your CyberStart experience.
7. **Find and follow industry experts and newsletters.**
You will be amazed at how much you can pick up from hearing industry
experts talk about new problems or flaws. Perhaps sign up to the [SANS NewsBytes newsletter](https://www.sans.org/newsletters/newsbites/)
 and learn about the latest tactics cyber criminals are using. Find some
 top cyber security personalities and see what they have to say. You
will learn about new tools and solutions, which will help you in later
challenges! Keep a list of relevant articles or tools and while you are
learning scan over it from time to time.

> Above all else, don't give up. CyberStart is designed to be
> challenging and the time you spend confused before overcoming a
> challenge is what makes it rewarding. Countless others have solved that
> challenge before you, and you can too!
