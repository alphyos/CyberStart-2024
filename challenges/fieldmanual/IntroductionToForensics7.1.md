## FORENSICS

# Introduction to forensics

Digital
forensics is the process of examining digital media in order to
identify, preserve, recover, and analyse, then presenting facts about
that digital information.

In other words, the goal is to acquire an accurate representation of
the data on a target system and then evaluate it for clues, in order to
find out what happened.

It can be used in incident response, where an analyst must find out
if a system has been breached, and how it was breached. Digital
forensics is also used in criminal cases where there is suspicion that
an offence was carried out through the use of a computer.

The first step in any forensic investigation is to decide on
priorities. For example, is your priority to preserve evidence so that
it will hold up in a court of law? Is it more important that the
investigation be completed quickly, in order to determine the scale of a
 breach, even if it means that the evidence collected may not be
admissible in court? These are things that upper management must decide.

Whatever the focus and aims of the forensics investigation, you'll
likely find it a fascinating subject. Let's start looking at the crucial
 areas of this really important field of cyber security investigations!
