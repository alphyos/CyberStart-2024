## BINARY

# Taking it further

Binary
building, exploitation and bug hunting are mighty big topics. It can
take a lot of time to learn all the skills to find impactful bugs and
help fix them.

For CyberStart specifically, you'll definitely want to look into
binary debugging and manipulation. Skills and tools that will allow you
to step through a program's code, inspect data and functions, and even
modify them. You would typically do this through a "Debugger" and very
commonly used app in the industry is [GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/)

A solid understanding of programming, assembly and architecture are
crucial to success. You can find lots of free resources to learn more,
and participating in CTFs is a wonderful way to learn more in this
space.

There are also some books we would recommend if you are really interested in this area:

* Practical Malware Analysis
* The Ghidra Book: The Definitive Guide
* Hacking: The Art of Exploitation
* Assembly Language for x86 Processors (older, but a wonderful introduction)

> You can find binary challenges later in CyberStart, and we are
> introducing more content and video guides all the time! The key with
> binary exploitation is not to give up - it is a tough skill to master!
