## Dots and dashes

Morse code is a method of encoding text using sequences made up of signals, each a **dot** or **dash**. These have over the decades been commonly relayed as a short (dot) or long (dash) audible sound which may sound like a *blip* and *bleep*.
 Given the 2 state nature of the values, they're a little similar to how
 a binary value can be 1 or 0. The values they represent don't cover a
very wide range of characters (just A - Z and 0 - 9) but Morse code has a
 fascinating history, particularly in the navy of some countries, and is
 still used today.

Here's some examples of Morse code sequences:

| Character | Sequence |
| --- | --- |
| A | . - |
| B | - . . . |
| C | - . - . |

> A common use of Morse code is signaling for help with SOS: `. . . - - - . . .` - three dots, three dashes and three dots.

Morse code can be transmitted audibly using a single tone, which made
 it invaluable in early telephony uses before the Internet. It can be
decoded manually using a lookup table, pen and paper, but alternatively,
 there are numerous tools available to help you decode it, and even some
 Python modules!
