# Stuck?

It can be frustrating if things aren't going as you expected, but this can be the case occasionally. Persistence is crucial, but there may come the point when you've tried lots of different approaches, researched all you can, and you're truly stuck.

Firstly, we'd suggest reading the briefing again - sometimes a small, but crucial, detail could have been overlooked. Browsing the Field Manual is a good option as it contains great and challenge relevant advice. Researching online for the topic you're stuck on, might provide a direction or info for you, plus learning to search effectively is a vital skill for the future too. If that's not helping, perhaps the hint option on the challenge could provide the boost you need.

Beyond this, you might need advice from others. Reaching out to friends, a teacher and fellow community members could be a good option but remember to only ask for pointers, rather than the solution, so you understand why something is being done. Whoever you talk to, be specific about the challenge you're on, which base and perhaps the URL, but most crucially, what's expected and what's actually happening.

> Whether you are asking a friend for help, a fellow agent in the community, a teacher, or the support team: always take a moment to step back and read your message. Check the details would make sense to someone reading it without your knowledge of the problem. This is a great life skill too!

# Errors or General App Issues

If you're experiencing issues with the Cyberstart app be sure to check out the [FAQ page](https://help.cyberstart.com/help).

The CyberStart support team won't be able to provide tips or answers (as all of the above should be your approach), but are certainly available if you feel you're seeing an error that shouldn't be there. If that's the case, you can get in touch with support@cyberstart.com for tech assistance. When submitting a ticket try to keep in mind:

1. Be specific about what the problem is. "I can't login" with no further information makes it impossible to locate your account or troubleshoot. If there is an error code, share it. If you have an issue at a specific URL, let us know. A particular challenge is broken? Which base, level and challenge?
2. Include a screenshot if you can. It can really help to speed up the troubleshooting process and understand your issue.
3. Include your method to replicate the issue. This is extremely valuable practice for any number of technology or computer science professions. What did you do to find the issue? If you can write instructions someone else can follow, we can help you much more quickly!
4. Who are you? If you have an issue related to your account then we need your e-mail address for your CyberStart account. If you do not e-mail us from this account we can't find you and help you. You would be amazed how often people mail asking for help with their account and don't let us know 'which account'.
5. Is it a security or data risk? You might discover a bug or defect as a part of your engagement with CyberStart that leads to you being able to access or damage the data of other users. If this happens it makes it a high severity flaw! You can contact our team, and per our FAQ we recognise and credit users that help us keep everyone's cyber security learning safe!

Whether you need a little help or facing an error you can't get past, we're sure you'll get past it soon and onto more learning and gameplay in CyberStart.
