## Welcome to the wonderful world of programming!

Programming is a vast topic area; there are lots of different
languages and specialities, it's a place you can spend your entire
career building all kinds of things - from web applications to operating
 systems, code that powers your fridge to code that analyses
interactions between race cars in Formula 1. It is *all around us* in the modern world!

Being able to program is a valuable skill in technology generally,
but even if you don't have a major passion for it, understanding a
little programming can help you a great deal in computer science as well
 as every day life. In cyber security you don't have to be a master
programmer to succeed, but understanding a few concepts about how a
computer stores information and how we interact with programs can unlock
 amazing skills. From knowledge of how cyber criminals can trick a
computer into running code that it shouldn't, exploits that enable
attackers to connect to a server and gain access to an account, or even
just simple automation of mundane tasks; programming is an extremely
useful skill.

Programming can be both easy to learn, but also very challenging.
Like learning another spoken language, it takes time to pick up the
vocabulary and learn the grammar. Fortunately there's a wealth of
resources to help you learn and once you've cracked it the results are
phenomenal. Just remember: you'll need to be persistent.

Developing solid programming skills isn't going to happen overnight
or by reading a book (or this Field Manual!) and watching a few videos.
You need to get your hands dirty! You need to write code to learn code.
You'll write code that doesn't work, debug it, fix it, and break it
again many times. It's through these problems and interesting bugs
you'll encounter that you gain a better understanding and your skills
improve. Plus, finally fixing that error you've been struggling with for
 the last hour can be super satisfying!

So what kind of things could you do with these new programming
skills? Well, let's say you have a zip file secured with a password, but
 you can't quite remember what it is. You could write a simple program
to iterate and try a bunch of passwords instead of doing it manually.
You could create a program to scrape content from websites to gather [open source intelligence](https://play.cyberstart.com/field-manual/8fa15b22-d7eb-11eb-bd75-0242ac140009)
 for a pentest you're working on. Or perhaps you need to be able to
encrypt data and transmit it between two systems using sound!
Programming opens up a world of creativity and possibilities.

A great place to start learning Python, a user friendly and very
useful programming language, is the Moon Base. There you can experiment
with learning and writing code without needing your own local
environment. We suggest Python as a good language to begin with as it's
very intuitive and easier to write than a lot of other languages. It has
 a wide range of available modules and libraries, and overall with very
few lines of code you can create some very powerful programs. Many tools
 you'll encounter as you progress through CyberStart, and in the
industry in general, are written in Python!
