# ðŸ‘½ First Contact - L02 C02

The Cyber Protection Agency has launched a satellite into space. Its main goal is to help monitor criminal activities back on Earth... or so we thought. Instead, weâ€™ve detected aÂ **strange signal**Â coming from deep space!

Curiosity has got the better of us and weâ€™d like to explore where the signal is coming from. But, the satellite'sÂ **software isnâ€™t working correctly**Â and we are unable toÂ **target objects**Â from the region of space the signal is coming from. Can you find a way around it?

**Tip:**Â TryÂ **selecting items**Â in the space scene andÂ **find somewhere to put the coordinates**.

## Need a hint?</summary>

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Notice if you click on an item in the space scene it provides x & y values? You may be able to edit the web address to use those values and begin listening for signals from that planet!

> When editing the web address, pay extra attention to characters like ? and

## Step by Step</summary>

- This challenge is randomized, so the number of steps, corrdinates, and specific planets are unique
- Click on any planet to note their `x and y coordinates`
- Alter the url to include the coordinates, replacing the zero values and hit enter:
  - `https://satellite.cyberprotection.agency/position?x=000&y=000`
- Continue to do this for all of the planet's coordinates until the correct one is found
  - In my experience, this tends to be the 5th or 6th planet
