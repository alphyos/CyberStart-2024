# ðŸ‘½ First Contact - L02 C02

The Cyber Protection Agency has launched a satellite into space. Its main goal is to help monitor criminal activities back on Earth... or so we thought. Instead, weâ€™ve detected aÂ **strange signal**Â coming from deep space!

Curiosity has got the better of us and weâ€™d like to explore where the signal is coming from. But, the satellite'sÂ **software isnâ€™t working correctly**Â and we are unable toÂ **target objects**Â from the region of space the signal is coming from. Can you find a way around it?

**Tip:**Â TryÂ **selecting items**Â in the space scene andÂ **find somewhere to put the coordinates**.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Notice if you click on an item in the space scene it provides x & y values? You may be able to edit the
web address to use those values and begin listening for signals from that planet! When editing the web address,
pay extra attention to characters likeÂ `?`Â and `&` in the URL, they have special meaning.
```

## Step by Step

- Click on the blue planet and notice the given x and y coordinates.
- Change the url to "`https://satellite.cyberprotection.agency/position?x=440&y=445`".
