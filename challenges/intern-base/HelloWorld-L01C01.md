# ðŸŒŽ Hello World - L01 C01

We've found a profile page of a known hacker that we need to get in contact with but most of the informationÂ **visible**Â on the page is useless to us. However, there is oneÂ **secret**Â way to contact him - he's managed to inject on the page aÂ **hidden email address**. Agent 707, we need you to find his email address!

**Tip:**Â The email address is the flag.
