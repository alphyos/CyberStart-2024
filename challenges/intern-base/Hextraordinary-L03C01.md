# 🔢 Hextraordinary - L03 C01

Agent 707, the agency have been in contact with a rival hacker who goes by the name "**ROXy**". She keeps telling us she runs a **logical operation**, particularly when analysing **differences in values**, but we're not sure what she means.

ROXy is willing to work with us... if we can prove we're as smart as she is. Before handing over any information, she's given us a code to break first.

**Tip:** The flag is the secret code. 

```
💡 Hint: Agent Q just noticed the informant's name, "ROXy", has XOR in it backwards... it may be just a coincidence,
   but we don't think so. It also looks like the values are all in the 0-9 and A-F range, we think there's an encoding
   scheme like that?
```

## Step by Step

- Insert into an [XOR calculator](https://xor.pw/#) with the first set of numbers as an input and the second as the second. Add “0x” in front of the output.
- If you can help us unravel this code, we'll gain an important new informant.
