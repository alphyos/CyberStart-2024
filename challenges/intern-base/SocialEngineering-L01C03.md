# 🐩 Social Engineering - L01 C03

Permission has been granted to try and log into the Chirp social media account of a hacker who goes by the name of **D4YDR3AM**. Luckily for us, they've been clumsy with their personal information. We know their dog's name is **Barkley** and they were born in **1993**. Can you use what we know about them to **guess their password** and get us into their account?

**Tip:** Get the flag by guessing the correct password to log into the account.

```
💡 Hint: Many people use passwords that combine pieces of personal information. Try combining the pieces of 
   information you have in different ways.
```

## Step by Step

- The password is a combination of “**Barkley**” and “**1993**”.
- Type “`Barkley1993`” into the password area and enter to get the flag.
