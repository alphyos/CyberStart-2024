# 🐩 Social Engineering - L01 C03

Permission has been granted to try and log into the Chirp social media account of a hacker who goes by the name of **D4YDR3AM**. Luckily for us, they've been clumsy with their personal information. We know their dog's name is **Barkley** and they were born in **1993**. Can you use what we know about them to **guess their password** and get us into their account?

**Tip:** Get the flag by guessing the correct password to log into the account.

### $${\color{green}\large\sf{Success!}}$$
### $${\color{green}\sf{Great job intern! This is a great reminder of how easy many passwords can be to guess. In particular if they use personal information that is common knowledge; like the names of pets, family and birth year. Those passwords are easy to remember... and even easier for hackers to guess!}}$$
