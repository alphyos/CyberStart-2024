Upon locating a strange signal from deep space, agents from the Cyber Protection Agency have been trying to make sense of its output but have failed so far. We think that the output is being encoded using Binary. So, we believe that if we can decode the output we will reveal a hidden message! Can you help us do that?

Tip: Search the Internet for tools that can decode binary.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Using an online tool, decode the binary signal into readable text and answer the question within.
   The answer must be encoded in binary before responding.
```

## Step by Step

- Click the "analyze signal" button
- Copy the series of binary numbers into a [Binary to ASCII convertor](https://rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html)
- A mathmatical equation should be presented to you
- Put your answer through an [ASCII to Binary convertor](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html)
  - This can be in the format of the arabic numeric or alphabetical spelling, with or without capitals
- Copy the resulting binary and paste it into the reply field of the challenge
- If correct, the flag should appear
