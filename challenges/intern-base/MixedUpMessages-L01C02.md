# ⏲️ Mixed Up Messages - L01 C02

We've been informed that a group of hackers are **communicating** cryptically on a social media site.

Their messages have been getting increasingly cryptic; so much so that all of the posts now look **jumbled up** and don't seem to make any sense!

We've found one post that we believe contains an important **secret**, and we need you to find out what that secret is so we can be ready to stop a possible cyber attack!

**Tip:** The secret is the flag.
