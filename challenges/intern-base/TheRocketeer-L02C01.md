# 🚀 The Rocketeer - L02 C01

We’ve been working with a well-known spaceflight agency to help us launch a satellite into space. The satellite will monitor criminal cyber gangs and help us in our effort of preventing large-scale attacks.

They have given us a command that triggers a **launch sequence** that will send a rocket with the satellite attached to its destination. The command is `launchRocket()` Can you figure out how we can run it so we can send this satellite to work?

**Tip:** You can run JavaScript commands in the **Console**.

```
💡 Hint: Look for a button that will open a Console for you to run the command within.
```

## Step by Step

- Click the top right blue button.
- Type “**launchRocket()**” and press enter.
