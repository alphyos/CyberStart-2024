# ðŸš€ The Rocketeer - L02 C01

Weâ€™ve been working with a well-known spaceflight agency to help us launch a satellite into space. The satellite will monitor criminal cyber gangs and help us in our effort of preventing large-scale attacks.

They have given us a command that triggers aÂ **launch sequence**Â that will send a rocket with the satellite attached to its destination. The command isÂ `launchRocket()`Â Can you figure out how we can run it so we can send this satellite to work?

**Tip:**Â You can run JavaScript commands in theÂ **Console**.
