# üí® Dot Dot Dash - L07 C01

It's time to go old-school, Agent 707.

We think the Chiquitoos have an insider that works on the ships carrying the shipping containers full of Cola. Obviously they don't want to be found out while passing details to the gang members on the nearby reconnaissance boats, so they've resorted to using Morse code to communicate. We've tapped into the frequency they're using and funneled the code into our Morse code tool. Decipher the message and see what they're saying.

**Tip:**¬†In the message they mention a ship name; that's the flag. 

```
üí° Hint: In Morse code, a quick flash is a dot, a long flash is a dash and a pause is a space.
   Write out the series of dots and dashes and match it up to the chart to turn them into letters.
