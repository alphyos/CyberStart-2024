# 🛣️ Route Into The Router - L03 C07

Good news, we've managed to get access to the login page for one of the gang's home routers. Useful... if only we knew the username and password. I wonder if they've been lazy and left the router's **default username and password** active? The router is just a standard Nethub 5000.

**Tip:** Find the correct username and password then login, to get the flag. 

```
💡 Hint: We've given you access to a search engine called Moogle. Try searching for the Nethub 5000 and see if you can find a
   mention of the default username and password online.
```

## Step by Step

- Hitting search on “Moogle” will show some results which reveal the username as “`admin`” and password as “`password`”.
- Navigate to the router login page and submit the right login details to get the flag.
