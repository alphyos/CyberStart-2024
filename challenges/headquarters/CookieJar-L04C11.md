# 🍪 Cookie Jar - L04 C11

Now that we've gained access to The Choppers' intranet site it has dawned on us that they might have more than one level of user. If we could log in as an admin user it might allow us to see much more.

Sometimes you can change the session cookie to achieve that, and admins often have an ID of 0. Why don't you give it a try?

**Tip:** Use the browser extension to help modify the cookie. If you're able to change your access to admin level the code will appear.

```
💡 Hint: Session cookies are often accessible and editable by users. If you can figure out how to edit the one on this site
   and guess the session ID of an admin user, then you're in luck - the flag will appear! Oh, and don't forget to refresh the
   page once you've edited the cookie.
```

## Step by Step

- Click on the cookie icon on the top right corner of the webpage and change “`Cookie Value`” to **0**.
- Click on `Save changes to cookie and reload the page` and the flag should pop up.
