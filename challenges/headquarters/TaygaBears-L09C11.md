# üêª Tayga Bears - L09 C11

One of the Spetzners lives in Tayga, a heavily forested area with a lot of bears! So it's no surprise that he spends some of his spare time taking photographs of them and posting them to a nature site called –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å —Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ç—å (which is Russian for "Bear Watch"). We thought it was fairly innocent until one of the agents spotted something weird about one of the images.

Take a look at them and see if you can spot what it is.

**Tip:**¬†There's a hidden file, open it to get the flag.

## Step by Step</summary>

- Download the files and run `binwalk *` in the directory where the files are located
  - Notice image 6 has a zip folder in it
  - Run `binwalk --dd='.*' imagename.jpg`
- Go to the newly created directory where binwalk extracted all the files
  - One of these is a zipfile
  - Run `unzip filename`
  - Give permissions to the newly extracted file using `sudo chmod +x extracted_executable`
- Run `./extracted_executable`
- The flag should appear after a while

`flag: B3znJluppFPJnNG7PAg`
