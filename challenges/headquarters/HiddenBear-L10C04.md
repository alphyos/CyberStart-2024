# üêª Hidden Bear - L10 C04

It seems the Spetzners will find any way possible to keep their secrets from us. And we think they know we're on to them, so they're doubling down with strange new ways to hide their messages.

Here's a good example: you may remember the Bear Watch site from the previous level? Well, we've been looking at one of the images from that site for days and can't seem to crack what it's hiding. Take a look and see if you can find it.

**Tip:**¬†Manipulate the image in some way to get the flag.
