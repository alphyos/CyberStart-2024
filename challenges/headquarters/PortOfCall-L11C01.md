# ðŸ¥Œ Port of Call - L11 C01

Quick job for you Agent 707. We think the gang have a port running between 14000 and 15000 that might expose some interesting information about them, we've temporarily pointed our domain `services.cyberprotection.agency` to their server. Use that address to find the service and connect to it.

**Tip:**Â Connect to the port to get the flag.

ðŸ’¡ Hint: You'll want to use nmap for this. Make sure you specify the port range!
