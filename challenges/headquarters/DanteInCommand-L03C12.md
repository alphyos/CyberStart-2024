# 🧨 Dante In Command - L03 C12

We **found a file** in an intercepted email from one of The Chopper gang members, Dante, but it needs to be **run from the command line** in order to make it work.

We think it might be a program the gang are writing to gain access to their competitors' computers, so it's important we check it out.  

**Tip:** Run the program from the command line; the flag will be in the output.

```
💡 Hint: Running a file from the command line is actually really straight forward. See what happens when you run the file by
   using `$ ./filename`. If you get it right then the flag will be in the output.
```

## Step by Step

- Run “ls” to list directories and find the program we are trying to run.
- Run the command by typing `./passcrack`.
