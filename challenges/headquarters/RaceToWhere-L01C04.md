# 🚖 Race To Where - L01 C04

Here's an interesting one for you Agent 707 - on the weekend the gang released what looks like a one page website advertising an upcoming bike race they're organizing. Being cyber detectives we're naturally curious that things might not be as they seem. Have a look at the site - it looks like there are just two images on the page, a logo and the poster, can you **find** anything suspicious, maybe **some text?**

**Tip:** Find the **hidden** clue and it'll lead you to the flag.

💡 Hint: Try highlighting the whole page (i.e. select all), does it reveal anything else?

- Highlight the page to find text that says “Go to `/secret.html`”.
- Entering this at the end of the url gets you the flag.
