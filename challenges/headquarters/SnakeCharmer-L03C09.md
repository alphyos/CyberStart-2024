# 🐍 Snake Charmer - L03 C09

We've just intercepted an email from one of the gang members with a file attached called "**passgen.py**". It looks like a **Python** script.

We've heard that the gang is looking for a way to make their passwords more secure, perhaps using code like this to generate them. See if you can **run the code** so we know exactly what it does.

**Tip:** The output from the code is the flag you need.

```txt
💡 Hint: Running a python script from the terminal is as simple as `$ python filename`
   where filename is the name of the file of course.
```

## Step by Step

- Run the command `python passgen.py`.
