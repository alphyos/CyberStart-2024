# 🏆 The Competitor Revealed - L03 C10

We've intercepted some encrypted text from one of the gang members, which we think might include the **name of the competitor company** that they intend to target.

We know it uses a letter **Substitution Cipher** and luckily we have some **Frequency Analysis** counts. At CPA we have our very own tool for helping agents to break this kind of encryption. Use it to try and work out what the text says.

**Tip:** The flag is the name of the competitor company.

```
💡 Hint: Keep trying different letters until you have a word that makes sense. A common approach with Frequency Analysis is
   to try two and three letter words first - they are likely to be words such as: is, and, the, are. Once you have those and
   some letters unraveled, things might start to become clearer.

## Step by Step

- The correct letter will produce a green background, by taking a good guess at what some of the letters may be like a two letter word being “to”, “is”, “so” or other common words will uncover the entire message slowly.
