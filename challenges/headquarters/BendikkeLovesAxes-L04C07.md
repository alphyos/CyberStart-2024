# ðŸª“ Bendikke Loves Axes - L04 C07

Whilst doing some background research on one of the gang members, Bendikke, we discovered that she writes a blog all about axes. We suspect she might be using the backend of the blogging tool to store information about how they plan to attack their competitors and, more importantly, the specific machinery blueprints they are after. If we knew that, it would really help us foil the gang's plans.

See if you can find the login page on the blog and use some of the techniques you've learned already to break in.
