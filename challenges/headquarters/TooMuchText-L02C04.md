# ⌨️ Too Much Text - L02 C04

Ok, this is really weird, one of the gang just emailed every other gang member a HUGE text file with loads of random Latin text in it. There must be a **secret code** hidden in it, right?

**Tip:** Find the **secret code**, that's the flag.

```txt
💡 Hint: It's a lot of text, but have you tried just searching it for the words "secret" or "code" - sometimes the simplest
   things work!
```

## Step by Step

- Press Ctrl + F and search for either "code" or "secret" and you will find the flag.
