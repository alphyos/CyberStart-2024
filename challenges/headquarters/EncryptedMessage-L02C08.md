# ⚠️ Encrypted Message - L02 C08

We have an undercover agent in one of the Slootmaekers bike shops, posing as a bike mechanic. We need to send him an urgent message but the only phone he has is one the gang gave him and may be monitoring. We have a specific **Substitution Cipher** we can use - quickly **encode the message** and **send it**.

**Tip:** Correctly **encrypt the message** and **send it** to get the flag.

```txt
💡 Hint: Simply replace whatever each letter in the message is with whatever letter the key tells you to change. For example,
   if the key shows A = S, change all A's in the messages to S's.
```

## Step by Step

- Simply, this requires a caesar cipher shifted over 5 since A = F which is 5 characters over.
  - The encrypted message should start and end with the following `LFSL RFD [REST OF FLAG] MTZXJ G`.
