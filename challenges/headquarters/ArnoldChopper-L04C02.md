# üè∞ Arnold Chopper? - L04 C02

A few days ago one of our field agents, who is now working undercover for The Choppers, found two pages of a book ripped out and left on a table.

We weren't sure if it meant anything, but then today we intercepted an email containing some cryptic code. It looks like the gang is getting smarter with its encrypted messages and is now using Arnold Ciphers.

See if you can use the intercepted code and the two pages of the book to discover what it means.

**Tip:**¬†We believe the message contains a code, that's the flag.

```
üí° Hint: An Arnold or book cipher is one where the numbers refer to the position of words in the text. In this case, it
   looks like each set of three numbers refers to the page, line and word. So 02.04.03 would mean the second page,
   fourth line down, third word along. Once you understand that, decrypting the message should be easy, and the flag is
   hidden within.
```

## Step by Step

- Use the provided book to decipher the numbers each set of three, two number pairs correlates to the page number, line number, and word in the sentence.
- The decoded message is the following:
    - Kinsmen, the commands. Go tonight, the moment is now. Lower opportunity in the morning. Code is `[REDACTED]`. Good fortune.
