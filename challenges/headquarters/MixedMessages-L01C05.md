# ðŸš¦ Mixed Messages - L01 C05

Our team have been monitoring some text message chatter between two of the senior gang members over the last week. There was nothing interesting of note until suddenly all their messages started coming throughÂ **mixed up**.

At first we thought it might be a technical problem, but then it occurred to us that they might be deliberatelyÂ **encoding the messages**Â somehow.

I've had one of the agents forward you one of the messages, see if you canÂ **decode it**.

**Tip:**Â **Decode the message**, we think it mentionsÂ **two colours**, combine them (e.g.Â **redgreen**) and that's the flag

```txt
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Hmm, it doesn't look like the words are reversed, but have you tried reversing just pairs of letters?
```

## Step by Step

- [Unscramble the given string of letters](https://wordunscrambler.me/) which gets you the two colors, **Blue** and **Yellow**.
- Combine them in either order of `blueyellow` or `yellowblue` and enter the flag.
