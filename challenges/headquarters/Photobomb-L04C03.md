# ðŸ—» Photobomb - L04 C03

Our team has been monitoring The Choppers' web traffic and it seems they've been spending a lot of time on a photo-sharing site, especially one particular page. Did you know you can hide a message inside a file? Maybe this image contains a hidden message. Why don't you take a look and see if you can find out?

**Tip:**Â The flag is in the image.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Perhaps try opening the image in a text editor or using your local terminal to look for strings in the file. If
   there's a secret message in there, those will be great ways to find it.
```

## Step by Step

- You can use a Linux terminal to download the image and run `strings imagename` to get the flag.
- Alternatively, you could use [Aperi Solve](https://www.aperisolve.com/) which will run `strings` for you.
- The flag is one of the first lines of strings.
