# 🎂 Social Secret - L01 C01

Agent 707, we think we might have a way to log into a social media account of one of the gang using the site's password reset form. We have two key pieces of information: his **username** and his **favourite color**. We just need his **age** and we'll be able to log in - can you **guess it from the information we already have**?

**Tip:** **Get the age correct** and submit the form to get the flag.
