# ðŸ’” More Broken Bicycles - L02 C05

Remember the blog post by Lars De Vries from the last floor? Well, we thought we'd figured out what the issue was with the broken images on the site, but on this page that we've just come acrossÂ **all the images already have file extensions**, butÂ **one is still broken**. Can you see what's wrong?

**Tip:**Â **Get the image to show**Â to get the flag.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: The image seems to have the wrong file extension. The other images all have .jpg, but this one has .gif, try
   changing it. Your browser has "Dev Tools" and an "Element Inspector", within it, that can help with this.
```

## Step by Step

- Use inspect element to change the `.gif` file extension of the broken photo to `.jpg`.
