# 🏧 Broken Banks - L01 C02

Agent 707, it looks like the gang are trying to raise some money to fund their plans - and they're doing so by sending fake banking emails to the customers of their bike shop to try and defraud them. Take a look at this email we intercepted, it's seemingly from a well known bank, but can you **spot anything suspicious with it**? 🏦

**Tip:** Click on the **part of the suspicious email** that makes you think it's fake and you'll get the flag.

💡 Hint: Look carefully at the domain names of the sender's email addresses. Notice anything strange?
