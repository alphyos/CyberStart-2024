# 🕳️ Executable - L01 C06

Agent 707, quick question for you. One of the team sent me a screenshot of her filesystem browser with a bunch of files she recovered from a memory stick one of the gang discarded. She's asking if any of them are **executable files**. Take a look and let me know.

**Tip:** The **name of the executable file (including the extension)** is the flag.

```
💡 Hint: If there are any file extensions you don't recognize why not try googling them to see whether they are executables.
```

## Step by Step

- Check out [this website](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/executable) to see a list of executable file formats.
    - `.com` file extension is an executable file type, like .exe
- Submit the entire file name with the extention as the flag.
