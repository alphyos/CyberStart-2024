# â›© Spam For Dinner - L13 C01

Agent 707, we're trying to distract the gang whilst we try and gain access to their primary server and we think we've found a target for you.

We want to spam the booking form for their restaurants, the problem is the form is protected by a Captcha. You may be able to bypass the Captcha by tricking the form into using a different Captcha value; and if you can do so at least 5 times, that'll prove a successful bypass for the bot we'll create!

**Tip:**Â How are strings sometimes generated?
