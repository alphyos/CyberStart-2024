## Step by Step</summary>

- Run `nc services.cyberprotection.agency 13880`
- **LUKS** has an old exploit where if you enter the password incorrectly **93** times, it will fall back into intramfs mode
- You can use this to gain a root level shell on a machine
- Enter the password **incorrectly 93 times** (just enter is enough), then you can use the command `flag` to get the flag
