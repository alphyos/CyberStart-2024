# üê± Bad Kitty - L04 C12

For weeks now The Chopper gang members have been passing animated GIFs of kittens backwards and forwards in a chat room app called KittyLitter. We thought they were just messing around, until one of our agents noticed something interesting in one of the GIFs.

Take a look at the GIFs in this message thread and see if you can figure out what it is. Oh, by the way, one of the agents mentioned there are websites and online tools to help you investigate fast-moving GIF files.

**Tip:**¬†The flag is what you discover!

```txt
üí° Hint: If you look hard enough at one of the GIFs you'll see a hidden code - that's the flag! You might need to use a tool
   which breaks down the GIF into individual frames, perhaps do an internet search for "view a gif frame by frame".
```

## Step by Step

- Figure out a way to download the gif and view it slowed down, at the top left of the gif is a single black number for a couple frames and putting those numbers in order will get you the flag.
  - You can use gif scrubber or analyze the gif frame by frame with any other software.
