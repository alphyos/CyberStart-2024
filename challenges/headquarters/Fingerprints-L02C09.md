# ☝️ Finger Prints - L02 C09

We've found a secret lock-up used by the gang, a big breakthrough! One small problem, it uses an electronic keypad and requires a **four digit pin**.

We've noticed four of the numbers have fingerprints on and we've discovered that the lock only allows you to use **each number once** (i.e. you **can't do 7777**). Can you use that information to guess the right code? There are still quite a few possible combinations so you'll need to be systematic about it.

**Tip:** **Get the right code** to get the flag.

💡 Hint: The fingerprints show us which numbers are used in the correct combination, it's just a matter of trying all the
   combinations with those numbers until you get it right!

## Step by Step

- Go through all possible combinations of the digits `2, 4, 5, and 7` in various orders until it finally produces a flag.
