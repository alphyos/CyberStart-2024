# ðŸ’° Big Transfer - L03 C11

Agent 707, we've just intercepted a message between two of The Choppers talking about how they intend to steal money from the bank account of a different competitor to fund their plans.

It said they've found a weakness in the money transfer tool on the Global Bank website.Â **We've just successfully put through a test transfer**, can you prove it's vulnerable by transferringÂ **1000**Â to a bank account calledÂ **cpatestreceiver**Â fromÂ **cpatestsender**.

**Tip:**Â Sometimes URLs can be manipulated to bypass security.

## Step by Step</summary>

- Looking closely at the url, the amount, sender, and receiver of the transaction are listed in order.
- By manipulating the url by typing `https://www.bankwithglobal.com/transfer?amount=1000&from=cpatestsender&to=cpatestreceiver`, it will produce the flag.
