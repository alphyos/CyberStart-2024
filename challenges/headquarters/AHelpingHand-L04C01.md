# 👏 A Helping Hand - L04 C01

This morning I received a message from my counterpart in another agency. It seems they've been monitoring The Choppers too.

Helpfully they've sent us over an extract from a report one of their agents wrote, which they thought might be of use to us. Unhelpfully it's a PDF and much of the sensitive information has been redacted. Maybe you could find a way to see what it says.

**Tip:** We think it contains one of the gang's passwords - that's the flag.

```
💡 Hint: Drawing things on a PDF usually puts them on a separate layer. Try selecting and copying the text in the PDF and then pasting it into another program. By doing that you should be able to see the redacted parts and find the flag.
```

## Step by Step

- Download the PDF and open it
- Copy the last line of text, including the blacked out spaces
- Pasting it into any available text file or field will reveal the following sentence
    - “the password to their private server (`Johny[REDACTED]@`)"
- Insert this password as the flag
