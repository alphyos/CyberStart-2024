# ðŸ—¼ Tower of Wheels - L01 C11

So, this is strange - our undercover agent noticed that one of the gang has left a set of bike wheels set up in his workshop like aÂ **Tower of Hanoi**Â puzzle. We think it's wired up to his computer and might reveal something if our agent can complete the puzzle.

We've mocked up the puzzle for you to try using JavaScript. You can move the wheels by entering the following command:Â **move(<src>, <dst>)**, where theÂ **<src>**Â orÂ **<dst>**Â values can beÂ **"left"**,Â **"mid"**, orÂ **"right"**. For example, to move a wheel from the middle lane to the left lane you need to type:Â **move("mid", "left")**. If you get stuck typeÂ **"reset()"**Â to start again.

**Tip:**Â **Complete the puzzle**Â to get the flag.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: If you're struggling with the puzzle have a look online for guides on solving a "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle.
```

## Step by Step

- Use inspect element and go into the **console** tab.
- Type and enter commands to move the rings.
    - An example of the correct sequence of commands are below.
