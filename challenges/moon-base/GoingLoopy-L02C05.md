## Answer

```python
# CHALLENGE 1: Create an empty array called numbers.
numbers = []

# CHALLENGE 2: Write a while loop that will add 100 numbers to the
#              array, starting from the number 100 and incrementing by
#              2 each time. For example, start from 100, then the next
#              number added will be 102, then 104 and so on.
count = 0
number = 100
while count < 100:
    numbers.append(number)
    count = count + 1
    number = number + 2

# CHALLENGE 3: Write a for loop that will look through your numbers
#              array and print out each value in the array.
for x in numbers:
    print(x)
```
