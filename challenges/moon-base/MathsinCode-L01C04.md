# ðŸ§® Maths in Code - L01 C04

Are you any good atÂ **math** Agent 707? Well, computers certainly are, and you can use programming to do all kinds of clever things. Let's start you off with the basics, using programming to do someÂ **simple calculations.**

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Make sure you read the challenge carefully and print the challenge results. Doing the wrong calculation will obviously give you the wrong answer.

## Answer

```python
# CHALLENGE 1: Multiply 80 by 512 and save it to a variable called ch1.
ch1 = 80 * 512

# CHALLENGE 2: Add 1024 to 768 and save it to a variable called ch2.
ch2 = 768 + 1024

# CHALLENGE 3: Do 40 minus 100 and save it to a variable called ch3.
ch3 = 40 - 100

# CHALLENGE 4: Divide 33 by 6 and save it to a variable called ch4.
ch4 = 33 / 6

# CHALLENGE 5: Do 2 to the power of 6 and save it to a variable called ch5.
ch5 = 2 ** 6

# CHALLENGE 6: Save 0.33 to a variable called ch6_1, and save 5 to a
#      variable called ch6_2. Multiply ch6_1 with ch6_2 and save
#      the result to a variable called ch6.
ch6_1 = 0.33
ch6_2 = 5
ch6 = ch6_1 * ch6_2

# CHALLENGE 7: Print out the following variables in order:
#      ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5, ch6
print(ch1)
print(ch2)
print(ch3)
print(ch4)
print(ch5)
print(ch6)
```
