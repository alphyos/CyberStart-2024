# ðŸ˜• Alien Server - L04 C05

So, it seems the aliens are using what looks like human technology and we've identified they're running a server. We need you to try and connect to the server and see what's going on.

Instructions:

- Connect to the localhost server on port 10000.
- Then send and receive the response, for each of these values:
- USER, aliensignal, PASS, unlockserver, SEND, moonbase, END
- Note: You must receive data back from the server after you send each value

**Tip:**Â Get access to the server using the above instructions to get the flag.

```
ðŸ’¡ Hint: You will need to use a TCP Socket on this one.

It may be worth reviewing Level 3 Challenge 2.

Don't forget to receive the responses that the server sends!
