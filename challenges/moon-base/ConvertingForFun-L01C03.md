# ➡️ Converting For Fun - L01 C03

I hope you've been making notes Agent 707, as with this challenge you'll need to take what you've just learnt about **variables** and try converting the **types of data** they contain.

Oh, handy tip: if you make a bit of a mess with your code editor you can always click the "Reset code" button on the bottom right. It'll refresh the editor and put back the original text so you can start again.

> 💡 Hint: You can convert an integer to a string using the `str()` function, for example: `converted = str(carDoors)`. Always keep in mind what type of data a variable is holding, and convert between data types where you have to!

## Answer

```python
carInfo = "Number of Doors: "
carDoors = 2

# CHALLENGE 1: Convert carDoors to a string using type conversion.
# Save it in a new variable: carDoorsString
carDoorsString = str(carDoors)

# CHALLENGE 2: Print out the number of doors in the car
# using print(carInfo + carDoorsString)
print(carInfo + carDoorsString)
```
