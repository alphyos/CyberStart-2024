# ðŸ§µ Super Strings - L01 C05

So you've already learnt aboutÂ **strings**, but did you know there are some other really useful things you can do with them? Things likeÂ **concatenation** and usingÂ **string specifiers**. Take a look.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Remember that %s is a placeholder for Strings. %d is a placeholder for numbers (think of d for digit). %f is a placeholder for floats (remember these are numbers with a decimal point) Make sure you create the requested variables, and use them in a format string to print the specified sentence.

## Answer

```python
# CHALLENGE 1: Save the integer 5 in the variable ch1_1, and
#      the string "robots" in the variable ch1_2
#      Use a format string to print the following sentence:
#      There are 5 robots in the room

ch1_1 = 5
ch1_2 = "robots"
print("There are %d %s in the room" % (ch1_1, ch1_2))
```
